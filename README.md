## Color Scheme Generator

For this project I used the API https://www.thecolorapi.com/, the color input, and an options menu to allow the user to generate a variety of different color schemes to be used for graphic and web design.

I used a Figma file to design the layout for desktop/laptop screens, but I also wanted this to be easy to use on mobile.

Want to add another level of functionality, by adding in code that allows the user to copy hex codes to the clipboard for easy transfer to their own files.

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
